# Inline Editable Field using Formik

This repo contains a **headless** component wrapping the [**Formik**](https://formik.org) `<Form />` component and takes care of all the necessary state logic and event handlers for an **inline editable field**. 

*Why?* - I had a hard time to find a simple, elegant hand headlesss implementation, and decided to build a component myself.
